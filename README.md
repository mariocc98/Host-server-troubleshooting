# Host server troubleshooting
<br>
<h2>Description</h2>
The host server, responsible for hosting the cloud environment for the clients, failed. There was no response from the server, and IPMI was unresponsive. I was tasked with investigating the issue and resolving it as quickly as possible 
<h2>My Role</h2>
As the technician assigned to troubleshoot the server issue, I employed a variety of troubleshooting methods. Additionally, I contacted the server's primary provider for system diagrams and further information to aid in the investigation.
<h2>Technical Trobleshooting</h2>
First I followed a systematic approach, starting by inspecting the internal components to check for any loose connections. During my inspection, I found no visible damage on the motherboard. After further investigation, I decided to test the CPUs to identify any potential issues. This specific motherboard uses dual CPUs, so I tested one CPU at a time to determine if one had failed.

I started by testing CPU number one, which successfully loaded the BIOS. After removing CPU one, I installed CPU number two and attempted to boot the server. However, with CPU number two installed, the server failed to respond, and I observed red indicator lights on the server. From this, I concluded that CPU number two had failed. Additionally, upon further inspection, I noticed one of the motherboard connections was defective.
